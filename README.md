# 🎨 Dashboard Design 

**UTS Subject: Information Systems Data Visualisation Studio (2025)**
**Project by Jessica and other peers**
Tools: Tableau and Excel

## Project Overview
This project involved both individual and group-based components. Each student was responsible for designing two Tableau dashboard prototypes, while core planning tasks—such as defining the problem, identifying stakeholders, and shaping the dataset—were completed collaboratively as a team.
The project explores tertiary student stress factors — including academic, social, and psychological stress from the Kaggle dataset below.
**Dataset: Kaggle – Student Stress Monitoring Dataset

The goal was to apply the INSIGHT visual analytics framework to design an interactive dashboard prototype that presents meaningful insights for university stakeholders such as student support teams, academic advisors, and wellbeing staff.
The project was delivered across four structured assignments, each replicating a real-world data visualisation workflow:
1. Define the problem and stakeholders
2. Shape and prepare the dataset
3. Design initial charts and concepts
4. Build a final dashboard prototype

> This repository contains my initial visualisations and final Tableau dashboard prototypes, created as part of the final deliverables.

✔ Initial Chart Visualisations.twbx – early worksheets exploring stress factors
✔ Dashboard Prototype.twbx – final dashboard designs following feedback and refinement

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and analyse key stress factors impacting university students
- Follow a problem-driven visual analytics process (INSIGHT framework)
- Prepare, clean, and reshape the dataset for visual exploration
- Create insightful visualisations to answer stakeholder-driven questions 
- Design a polished, multi-chart dashboard prototype in Tableau

# 🔍 Methodology (INSIGHT Framework)
## 1️⃣ Identify Questions
- Conducted stakeholder analysis
- Defined primary questions + subquestions for student wellbeing teams
- Identified key indicators (KPIs) such as academic workload, sleep quality, anxiety levels, and social connectedness

# 2️⃣ Name KPIs
- Mapped each question to measurable fields
- Identified calculated fields required for analysis
- Determined which variables best represent stress patterns

# 3️⃣ Shape Data
Using Tableau Prep / Tableau Data Interpreter / Excel, I performed:
- Data cleaning
- Correcting data types
- Pivoting and splitting fields where necessary
- Checking for missing values
- Removing irrelevant or duplicate entries
- Creating calculated fields (e.g., stress level groupings, category scores)
- Building relationships across data tables

# 4️⃣ Initial Concept – Chart Development
- Individually created exploratory worksheets to answer the stakeholder questions:
- Bubble chart (observe correlations)
- Stacked bar chart (gender comparison between classroom attendance and loneliness levels)
- Scatter plots with trendlines (correlations with stress-related factors)
- Heatmaps (observe correlations)
  
Each chart included:
- A clear explanation of the question being answered
- List of fields & calculated fields used
- Insights + relevance back to the stakeholder problem

# 5️⃣ Gather Feedback
- Compared visual styles with group members
- Refined questions and chart selections
- Adjusted colour palettes, labels, axes, and filters

# 6️⃣ Hone Dashboard – Final Prototype
Designed two Tableau dashboards, each with at least 3 charts:
- Clean layout structured around the narrative
- Interactive elements (filters, highlights)
- Summarised insights for decision-making
- Focused on clarity, accessibility, and stakeholder relevance
