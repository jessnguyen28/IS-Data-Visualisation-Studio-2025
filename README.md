# 🎨 Dashboard Design 

**UTS Subject: Information Systems Data Visualisation Studio (2025)**
**Project by Jessica and other peers**

## Project Overview
This project involved both individual and group-based components. Each student was responsible for designing two Tableau dashboard prototypes, while core planning tasks—such as defining the problem, identifying stakeholders, and shaping the dataset—were completed collaboratively as a team.
The project explores tertiary student stress factors — including academic, social, and psychological stress from the Kaggle dataset below.
**Dataset: Kaggle – Student Stress Monitoring Dataset

The goal was to apply the INSIGHT visual analytics framework to design an interactive dashboard prototype that presents meaningful insights for university stakeholders such as student support teams, academic advisors, and wellbeing staff.
The project was delivered across four structured assignments, each replicating a real-world data visualisation workflow:
1. Define the problem and stakeholders
2. Shape and prepare the dataset
3. Design initial charts and concepts
4. Build a final dashboard prototype

> This repository contains my initial visualisations and final Tableau dashboard prototypes, created as part of the final deliverables.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and analyse key stress factors impacting university students
- Follow a problem-driven visual analytics process (INSIGHT framework)
- Prepare, clean, and reshape the dataset for visual exploration
- Create insightful visualisations to answer stakeholder-driven questions 
- Design a polished, multi-chart dashboard prototype in Tableau

## Tools & Techniques
- Tableau
- Excel
- 
🔍 Methodology (INSIGHT Framework)
1️⃣ Identify Questions

Conducted stakeholder analysis

Defined primary questions + subquestions for student wellbeing teams

Identified key indicators (KPIs) such as academic workload, sleep quality, anxiety levels, and social connectedness

2️⃣ Name KPIs

Mapped each question to measurable fields

Identified calculated fields required for analysis

Determined which variables best represent stress patterns

3️⃣ Shape Data

Using Tableau Prep / Tableau Data Interpreter / Excel, I performed:

Data cleaning

Correcting data types

Pivoting and splitting fields where necessary

Checking for missing values

Removing irrelevant or duplicate entries

Creating calculated fields (e.g., stress level groupings, category scores)

Building relationships across data tables

4️⃣ Initial Concept – Chart Development

Individually created exploratory worksheets to answer the stakeholder questions:

Bar charts (stress by category)

Stacked bars (multiple factor comparison)

Line charts (trend patterns)

Scatter plots (correlations between stress-related variables)
Each chart included:

A clear explanation of the question being answered

List of fields & calculated fields used

Insights + relevance back to the stakeholder problem

5️⃣ Gather Feedback

Compared visual styles with group members

Refined questions and chart selections

Adjusted colour palettes, labels, axes, and filters

6️⃣ Hone Dashboard – Final Prototype

Designed two Tableau dashboards, each with at least 3 charts:

Clean layout structured around the narrative

Interactive elements (filters, highlights)

Summarised insights for decision-making

Focused on clarity, accessibility, and stakeholder relevance

📦 Files Included

✔ Initial Chart Visualisations.twbx – early worksheets exploring stress factors
✔ Dashboard Prototype.twbx – final dashboard designs following feedback and refinement

📜 Acknowledgements

This project was completed as part of the UTS Data Visualisation Studio subject, delivered in 2025.
All dashboards and visualisations were created individually using group-developed problem definitions and stakeholder insights.
